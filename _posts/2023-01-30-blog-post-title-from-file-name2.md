## Blog Post Title From First Header 2

Due to a plugin called `jekyll-titles-from-headings` which is supported by GitHub Pages by default. The above header (in the markdown file) will be automatically used as the pages title.

If the file does not start with a header, then the post title will be derived from the filename.

This is a sample blog post. You can talk about all sorts of fun things here.

#### Some Java Code

```java
public static void main(Strng[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello");
}
```
