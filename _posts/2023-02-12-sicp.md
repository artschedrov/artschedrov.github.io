## SICP how introduction to basics of programming.



Much has been said and wrote about this book. Someone has criticized  this book, because of very mathematical approach here. Someone couldn’t understand Scheme’s dialect and functional style of programming. And someone could learned to think, thanks to this book.

## Briefly about this book.
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs— SICP - book of famous professors, Harold Abelson and Gerald Jas Sussman. This book wrote when personal computers started enter to consumer market. 
All examples in this book, were wrote on Scheme. Actually, part of the first chapter is dedicated to this dialect. I wouldn’t say that this dialect is difficult.
```scheme
;Hello world on Scheme

(begin
  (display "Hello, World!")
  (newline))
```

Others parts of the chapter talking about procedures, types of recursion, growth orders. Second chapter devoted to how build abstraction using data. Here we’ll look how sequences form pairs and lists data structures. In third chapter we’ll look such things how states of objects, parallelism and streams. Fourth and fifth, talking about metalanguage abstractions, the compiler and calculations on register machines.
In my opinion, the first three chapters are enough to study in modern realities. Only if you won’t to write your own Scheme compiler.

## Where to get Scheme runtime library?
For macOS, I was got Homebrew  package - [mit-scheme](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/mit-scheme). For linux distros, you can use package from https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/.

## Video resources
This book was written for course of [MIT 6.001](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE18841CABEA24090). There are recordings of lectures of this course on YouTube. And alternatively, you can look at the course of Berkeley  [CS61a](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhMnuBfGeCDNgVzLPxF9o5UNKG1b-LFY9).
This courses can serve as an addition to the book.

## And lastly
For me personally, this book helped me to understand more deeply the concepts of programming and working with data. SICP is unique in its ability—at least potentially—to alter your fundamental beliefs about computers and programming. But not everybody will experience this.
